12 Day Plan


Day 1-5:
create player character with movement left, right, jump, and crouch (use translation in direction of movement)
- mutable controls
- functions called to move
give player stats with functions to change them
use given sprites as the moving object, refer to tutorial on implementing sprites: http://www.williammalone.com/articles/create-html5-canvas-javascript-sprite-animation/

Day 5-7:
use same player creation to create second player

Day 8-9:
create score counter for defeating enemies; points increase with each consecutive wave
program enemy wave system
- set amount of enemies per wave
- enemy strength scales with each wave by arbitrary stat increase based on wave number

Day 10-11:
create hitboxes and detection when they overlap
create functions that extend hitboxes
use above functions to implement attacks as described

Day 12:
create enemies with movement (use above functions)
give enemies attack and ability to scale stats
use a system similar to waves to implement rounds for player vs player
